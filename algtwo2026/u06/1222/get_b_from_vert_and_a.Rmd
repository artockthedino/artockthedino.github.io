Question
========

A quadratic function has a vertex at $(`r h`,`r k`)$. One unit horizontally to the right, the curve also goes through point $(`r h+1`,`r k+a`)$.

The quadratic function could be expressed in standard form:

$$y=ax^2+bx+c$$

Calculate $b$.



Solution
========

Let the vertex be at $(h,k)$, so 

$$h=`r h`$$
$$k=`r k`$$

The second given point is 1 unit horizontally along the curve. Since $a$ represents the vertical stretch, we know that the second point is at $(h+1,k+a)$.

$$k+a~=~`r k+a`$$
$$`r k`+a~=~`r k+a`$$
$$a~=~`r a`$$

You've probably memorized the formula $h=-b/(2a)$. With a bit of algebra, we can solve for $b$.

$$b ~=~-2ah$$
$$b ~=~-2(`r a`)(`r h`)$$
$$b ~=~`r -2*a*h`$$
